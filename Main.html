                    After conducting our interviews, we created an affinity diagram and separated our affinity notes  into the following themes:
                </br> 1. People like to make a distinction between their work time and their play time.
                </br> Many interviewees noted that they liked to schedule work time blocks and non-work time blocks. During those work blocks they would try to be as productive as possible on work and not use other applications or devices to break focus. However, this also results quickly in mental fatigue and people will be inclined to take more breaks to relax themselves.
                </br> 2. People are exposed to plenty of distractions.
                </br> We asked our participants to briefly check and describe their Screen Time on their phones, and the majority of them happen to use a lot of social media and entertainment applications, like Tiktok and Instagram. Social networking introduces plenty of opportunities for fear of missing out (FOMO), and it leads to people picking up their devices to check social media more often than not.
                </br> 3. People try to utilize the time to its fullest potential.
                </br> There were also a number of participants that would meticulously plan out their day, and review their tasks at the end of the day. We found that these same people also were more productive and did not feel tired or stressed at the end of the day because their schedule was “just right”.
                </br> 4. People use various tools to aid in time management.
                </br> Some interviewees indicated that they have used tools like calendars, reminders, alarm clock and Notion, a website that help users organize jobs, to keep themselves on track of their schedules.
                </br> 5. People like to start the day by doing something productive.
                </br> We found that most people seemed to power through the day staying productive if they began the day by first exercising, doing housework, or simply just planning out their day. One interviewee said, “Once I start working, it is hard to stop.” People also tend to complete easy tasks before they start working on the hard tasks.
                </br> 6. Technology is more of a hassle than it is a blessing.
                </br> Some of the older participants found it difficult to manage technology, and preferred time scheduling the manual way -- pen, paper and post-it notes. Many participants also mentioned that they have not used a habit tracker before, some of which was because it was confusing and hard to use.

                Xinyi Hu: I am very thankful to Professor Matt and TAs for helping me so much. I also really appreciate my teammates, randomly assigned by Professor Matt and TAs. Joshua is a great teammate. He always takes the burden as a leader in the first half of the spring quarter. Joshua always comes up with great ideas and thanks for pushing us to finish the homework as early as possible. Yin-Jui is an excellent teammate, who teaches me a lot during the spring quarter. He is my best friend now. Finally, I still want to thank Professor for connecting us magically.
